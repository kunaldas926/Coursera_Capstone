Create a new repository on your Github account and name it Coursera_Capstone. I have prepared a series of videos to walk you through the process of creating a repository on Github and setting it up and getting started with Git. For Mac users, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7slAxcLWlcAqykFVFaBj_B2HEoJ4E1TH). For Windows users, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7slAxcLWlcCetian9RRoVZ_N3Ct5L_h3).

Now, start a Jupyter Notebook using any platform that you are comfortable with and do the following:

1 . Write some markdown to explain that this notebook will be mainly used for the capstone project.
2 . Import the pandas library as pd.
3 . Import the Numpy library as np.
4 . Print the following the statement: Hello Capstone Project Course!
Push the Notebook to your Github repository and submit a link to the notebook on your Github repository.
