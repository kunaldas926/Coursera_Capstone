**Instructions**

Here, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the accident data that you found to predict the different accidents' severity. Make sure to provide sufficient justification of why your solution is valid and why would your community or a group of people be interested in your project.

**Review criteria**

This capstone project will be graded by your peers. This capstone project is worth **70%** of your total grade. The project will be completed over the course of **2 weeks**. Week 1 submissions will be worth **30%** whereas week 2 submissions will be worth **40% of your total grade**.

For this week, you will required to submit the following:

1 . A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. (**15 marks**)

2 . A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. (**15 marks)**

For the second week, the final deliverables of the project will be:

1 . A link to your Notebook on your Github repository, showing your code. (**15 marks**)

2 . A full report consisting of all of the following components (**15 marks**):

· Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.

· Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.

· Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.

· Results section where you discuss the results.

· Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.

· Conclusion section where you conclude the report.

3 . Your choice of a presentation or blogpost. (**10 marks**)

**My Submission**

Project Title * : **My Second Peer-graded Assignment of Applied Data Science Capstone**

Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

This submission will eventually become your **Introduction/Business Problem** section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.

The link is: [https://github.com/kunaldas926/Coursera_Capstone/tree/main/Week%202%20Report.pdf/](https://github.com/kunaldas926/Coursera_Capstone/tree/main/Week%202%20Report.pdf/)

Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using.

This submission will eventually become your **Data** section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your **Data** section) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.
